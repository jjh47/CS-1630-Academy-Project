Git Workflow

/***** Initial Setup *****/

1. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
2. (On github.com) Fork the main repo into your personal account using the "Fork" button at the top.
3. Navigate to a place in your file system where you want to store code locally
4. Clone your fork url (git clone ssh://git@github.com:[your-username]/[project-name].git)
5. cd into the newly created directory (cd [project-name])
6. Add a remote tracking branch (we typically call this “upstream”) (git remote add upstream git@github.com:rafecolton/CS-1630-Academy-Project.git && git fetch upstream)
7. Create topic branch per story ("story" will be the name of your branch with this command) (git checkout -b story && git push origin story)

/***** Making Changes *****/

1. Make changes to files
2. Add changes to git staging area (git add .)
3. Commit changes to local git repo (git commit -m “Commit message”)
4. Push changes to your github account (git push origin story)
5. Repeat

/***** Saving Your Changes *****/

1. Pull in all new changes - pulls in changes from the upstream branch "master" and automatically tries to merge them with your local master branch (git pull upstream master)
2. Switch to master (git checkout master)
3. Merge changes to master (git merge story )
4. Push changes to master on your github account (git push origin master)
5. Send to upstream repo rafecolton/CS-1630-Academy-Project.git (git push upstream master)
6. Switch back to your branch for editing (git checkout story)

/***** Cleaning Up *****/

1. Once finished, delete the local branch (git branch -d story)
2. Purge the branch from origin (git push origin :story)
(note, if you wish to do further editing after performing these steps, you must recreate your branch with step 7 in Initial Setup)
